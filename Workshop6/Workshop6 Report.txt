Three Most Frequent Security Misconfigurations:
1. NO_NETWORK_POLICY
   Found: 53 Times
   Description: The misconfiguration category that is related with not specifying network policies. Without specifying network policies Kubernetes installations are susceptible to unauthorized accesses.

2. NO_ROLLING_UPDATE
   Found: 18 Times
   Description: The misconfiguration category that is related with not explicitly specifying RollingUpdate in the configuration file. A lack of rolling updates makes a Kubernetes installation susceptible to supply chain related attacks.

3. INSECURE_HTTP
   Found: 13 Times
   Description: The category of using HTTP without SSL/TLS certificates to setup URLs or transmit traffic inside and outside the Kubernetes clusters. Without SSL/TLS certificates, the data transmitted across Kubernetes objects are susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
